# Mixcast 4 Linux Audio Converter

**Fast audio conversion for the Tascam Mixcast 4 soundpad**

---

## What is this?

The Tascam Mixcast 4 is a powerful audio mixer and podcast workstation. But its official soundpad management software only runs on Windows and Mac‚Äîand it‚Äôs slow.  
**This project solves that:** It‚Äôs a simple, fast Linux shell script that converts any audio file into the exact WAV format needed for the Mixcast 4 soundpad.

## üöÄ Features

- **Universal Conversion:** Accepts any common audio format (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.)
- **Mixcast 4-Ready:** Outputs 16-bit, 48 kHz, mono WAV files with the correct filename pattern (A001.wav, A002.wav, etc.)
- **Plug & Play:** Designed to drop files directly onto your Mixcast 4 SD card
- **Faster than Official Software:** Instant results‚Äîno bloated apps or virtual machines
- **Linux First:** 100% native; no Wine, no Windows needed

## ‚ùì Why did I build this?

As a linux user, I was always locked down to the windows software for the Tascam Mixcast software.
I started doing some digging and found that you do not even need to have the software in order to add sounds to the soundpad and the device.
I built this because of my audio setup and how often I use the soundpad.
